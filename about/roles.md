<h2 id="teams">Teams</h2>

Rails Girls Summer of Code centers around teams. An ideal team has a pair of
students, one or more coaches and a project expert, called a mentor. Here's
what they do:

<h3 id="student">Student</h3>

Students, obviously, are the main characters in this program. They work on Open
Source projects full-time, from July-September. Every other role at Rails Girls
Summer of Code is dedicated to supporting these students in completing their
projects, and generally having a great learning experience.

Students also are the <strong>only</strong> people who will be remunerated if
accepted into the Summer of Code, unless they are in a volunteer team.

<h3 id="coach">Coach</h3>

Coaches are developers who work closely with their students. They help their
students to learn and accomplish their project tasks on a daily basis.

Ideally students and coaches share the same office space.

Since coaching can take up a lot of time, coaches will often team up and roster
themselves to students. Sometimes companies will allow employees to spend a
pre-determined amount of time on coaching during business hours.

Coaches do not have to be experts on the team's Open Source project, but they
need to:

<ul>
  <li>be able to support their student's learning process</li>
  <li>be skilled to understand the project and the mentor's directions</li>
</ul>

Should a coach not be available to help with an issue, students can also reach
out to remote coaches (see below). Coaches can also be mentors, which is
explained below.

<h3 id="mentor">Mentor / Project Maintainer</h3>

Mentors are experts on the Open Source project the team is working on. Ideally
they are decision makers, or work closely with decision makers, so they can set
general goals, give directions and provide feedback.

At the beginning of summer Mentors will help students design a roadmap for the 
project and throughout the project be available to review pull requests, help
with concepts and generally support the team.

Since students will be supported by coaches in their day-to-day work, the
workload for mentors is limited. This said, mentors can also assume the role of
a coach themselves.

<h2 id="support">Support and Organization</h2>

These roles take care of running the program as a whole, as well as on team
progress. If Summer of Code is a play, the organizers and support roles are
directing, painting sets, sewing costumes, stocking the catering cart, casting
the roles, doing up the play bills.

<h3 id="remote_coach">Remote Coach</h3>

Remote Coaches are available for help in a central slack channel, which is open to 
all students. They assist participants when their team coaches are not available 
or when they need specific technical help (e.g. help figuring out an error).

<h3 id="supervisor">Supervisor</h3>

Every team will be assigned a supervisor. Supervisors touch base with their
teams regularly to see how their team is doing, and if there's anything the
team needs help with.

Usually a supervisor's work means checking up on the team's work progress (see
the [Team log](/students/log)), as well as generally motivating them
through the rough coding patches they will inevitably experience.

In rare cases there may be the need to escalate issues to the organizers team,
e.g. when a team has stopped working.

A supervisor can be responsible for more than one team and is encouraged to
ease to organizational workload.

<h3 id="organizer">Organizer</h3>

Organizers are a pretty multi-skilled bunch. They are developers, designers,
content writers, community manager and business owners all volunteering their
time. They keep the website up, sponsors rolling in, and generally keeping
everything rolling. Organizers are the ones who answer your emails, select
applicants, monitor the social feeds and generally contribute their unique
skill set to an aspect of the organizational workload.

<h2 id="financial">Financial</h2>

Without the financial support of generous (and also incredibly amazing) donors,
Rails Girls Summer of Code simply could not take place! Here's to the
bacon-makers!

<h3 id="sponsors">Sponsors</h3>

Sponsors make it possible for Rails Girls Summer of Code to create a paid
program for participants. Sourced from all of the world, sponsors represent
a wide cross section of industry and allow for students to participate in the 
program by making generous donations. Though they often receive a great
deal of publicity and exposure as a result, they are not often directly
involved in the projects themselves. Instead they take on a more supporting
role in the experience of participants. 


<h3 id="coaching_company">Coaching Companies</h3>

A Coaching Company is one that host an entire student team for the duration of 
their project. In addition, they can allow employees to coach the participants. 
More information about this initiative is available here: <a href="/guide/coaching-company">Coaching Companies</a>. 
This role can be combined with the Sponsor role as well.

<h3 id="you">You</h3>

Our <a href="/campaign">crowdfunding campaign</a> is vitally important to
Summer of Code. Your donation goes directly to participants, and makes a big
difference to how many can be accepted. If your company cannot sponsor an 
entire package they can still donate a smaller amount via the campaign.
Every and any donation counts!.
