One, two, three, four, five and onto the sixth edition of RGSoC! It seems like it was yesterday that a cool bunch of people in Berlin decided to get together and launch the first edition of our summer of code.

Since then and in [#5YearsOfRGSoC](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/2017-02-16-anniversary-campaign) we have:

 - Trained 185 participants — that's 68 sponsored teams and 28 volunteering teams   
 - Reached people from 55 locations of 29 countries
 - Contributed to 67 Open Source Projects
 - Raised over 500.000 USD with the help of 115 sponsors and hundreds of individual donors
 - Participated in 63 conferences
 - Received a Ruby Hero Award

We couldn't be more happy about what we have accomplished together and we are extremely grateful to everyone who has been part of our collective journey — yes, you too!

### But you know what? 

We are even more happy when a former participant sends us an email saying they got their dream job as a software developer. Or when a one of our participants creates their own Open Source project. Or when someone decided to face their imposter syndrome and tried programming for the first time. Or when we inspire people to be Diversity and Inclusion advocates. Or when we have the incredible opportunity to meet in person the mentor who we have been talking through hangouts during the summer.

These are the big and tiny things that make everything magical. These are the things that make us feel *#ThankfulForRGSoC*. When we started RGSoC all of those years ago, all we wanted to do was to give something to the OSS and tech communities, and still we ended up receiving way more. You can relate to this, right? :)

Please, let's keep diversifying tech *together* and help to build a better future for everyone: **[help us fund RGSoC 2018](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign/) and while you're at it, share with us why you are #ThankfulForRGSoC!**
