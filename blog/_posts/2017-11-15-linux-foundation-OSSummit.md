TL;DR: Consider applying to both [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) and the [Linux Foundation's LiFT scholarship programme](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/free-linux-training/linux-training-scholarship-program)!

This year the [Linux Foundationâ€™s Open Source Summit Europe](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/archive/2017/open-source-summit-europe) took place in beautiful Prague. Fortunately, I was able to attend thanks to RGSoC!

The Open Source Summit is massive. In fact, it is a conglomeration of at least [four other summits](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/archive/2017/open-source-summit-europe-/program/about): LinuxCon, ContainerCon, CloudOpen and the Open Community Conference. In addition, it is run in conjunction with the [Embedded Linux Conference](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/archive/2017/open-source-summit-europe-/program/schedule). Over 2,000 technologists attend to share information and learn about the latest in open technologies such as Linux, containers, and cloud computing. I also learned a great deal about the community aspect of open source.
