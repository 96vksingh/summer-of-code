## The plan:
Before our Rails Girls Summer of Code started, we made a great plan what we will do:

1. create Feedback field to Food Pickup (Issue #235)
2. make trusted users/group admins    
3. create statistics for pickups that were done by users in kilograms   
4. build a quiz framework   

Optional: Android App, shared food & other things

Yay!


## The reality
We found out that we had no clue how difficult such an Issue can be! I mean like ABSOLUTLEY no clue. Comming from 'Codecademy', 'Learn Python the Hard Way' and some small pet projects we thought we would solve the first Issue within one week. We needed nine weeks till our first (noteable) pull request was excepted. So, how was that possible? 


## The first Issue

Our first task was to create Feedback field to Food Pickups. We spent a lot of our time learning about: Python, Django Framework, Django REST Framework, Swagger, how to troubleshoot our Git merge conflicts and how to solve our Docker complaints.


#### We have learnt:    
1. There are no shortcuts - we have to do Django tutorial and Django REST tutorial first  
2. Working both in the same time on the same branch will not speed up our progress! We are going to have many merge conflicts instead and we have to solve them all. This takes many, many hours :)  
3. We know what is server, browser, database, models, migrations, HTTP requests, querysets, filters and all these fancy words around we did not know how they are connected before.
4. And finally: This Issue is not so small as it looks!


#### We have built (status 6. September 2017):   
- a new API endpoint Feedback with HTTP methods GET, POST  
- integration API tests for Feedback that ensure that the user gets the correct GET/POST output  
- validation for field ```about``` and set the field ```given_by``` as read-only
- unit model tests for model Feedback



#### First Issue #253 in Numbers
(_we can do the number clickable: <https://github.com/yunity/foodsaving-backend/issues/253>_)

**Graphics**
1 Model.  
1 Serializer.    
1 Viewset.    
3 api endpoints.      
xxx Tests.    
xxx Lines of code.         
4000 hours of confusion (estimation based on daily log).    
100000000 Failures and Errors.
   
But at the end:    
2 happy RailsGirls.  
1 merged Pull Request. 

But our hardest part on our issue was to fix this test:
> code example

This test should return two instances of our test object and check that there are exactly 2 instances in the test database. There is alse a difference between a test database and live database what we have learnt as the time went :)

>> Put in Picture??


#### We still want to do:
- add HTTP method PATCH to Feedback
- change field ```weight``` to FloatField
- add filters to our Feedback + some other limitations
- refacture
- writing a Foodsaving-backend beginner guide. We already started here: <https://github.com/mddemarie/Foodsaving-Documentation/blob/master/foodsaving-backend-code-guide.md>


## Hackaton & Community

We attended HackDays in ImmobillienScount 11.07./13.07. and we have got very motivated with Stefan: "We can make it!"

Foodsaving founders invited us to their **Hackaton: 14.07./16.07**. We met here incredibly smart people - Tilmann Becker (@tiltec), Nick Sellen (@nicksellen) and Janina Abels (@djahnie) who put their time & energy into making the saving a food waste possible.

And of course we want to thank our great mentors again! Addintional to the ones we mentioned in our [first blog post](https://github.com/id-gue/summer-of-code/edit/gh-pages/blog/_posts/2017-07-13-print_hello_world.md) we had the luck that Derek Tingle (@tingled) <https://github.com/tingled> spend a lot of time with explaining us stuff. You should see how we navigates through the shell – it's amazing!!!

Also a bit thanks to SoundCloud!

## Future
Our Calls for papers for Codemotion Berlin 2017 and PyCon Germany 2017 were successfully selected! Yay! And we will have this talk: "A Summer of Foodsharing – Learn How to Code in an Open Source Project" in October 2017. We are going to talk about RailsGirls community, how to get into Open Source and present our project Foodsaving.

> _we could use a web link for Codemotion and PyCon Germany here_
 
@ines thinks about to become a Product Manager and help to prioritize coding tasks. Developers will realize how useful it is to scratch some unnecessary ideas that are totally unrealistic!!!   
@marie will get an amazing job as Backend Engineer in some country she has never been to.
