## **Spending a song-like summer!**

Our summer is like a song, sometimes we don‚Äôt know the lyrics, but we still enjoy the song. üé∂üòå And then we sing the song till we are familiar with the lyrics. Just like that, we were struggling with some concepts but we enjoyed learning and using those concepts successfully. So let‚Äôs see how interesting it is so far..

## How challenging it is?

So far, throughout the RGSoC journey, we‚Äôve faced many challenges. 

**Finding a place to work** ‚Äì Actually this was not a challenge at all. We asked from APIIT Sri Lanka, because we always knew, universities will never say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to the real need of students, and actually they did say YES.!! So finding the room was a success!

**Finding coaches** ‚Äì This was also not a problem since we first contact our coach Kasun, He helped to find other coaches who can helped us in different perspectives. Thank you Coach Kasun.

**Time management** ‚Äì Since one of us had to deal with the lectures and we participated in many events like competitions and conferences, together and as individuals apart from RGSOC. So we had to find time to cover those missing hours. Actually we had a great option for that. Working during weekends from home.  But that doesn‚Äôt mean we didn‚Äôt enjoy our weekend. Visiting your friend‚Äôs home during weekends, means, Fun!! It is very relaxing and we enjoying it a lot. And look what we had to deal with.. üòπ

**Learning new technologies and contributing to Open Source Projects** ‚Äì Since we were new to most of the concepts used in this project, sometimes we were stuck having no clue what to do solve some problems. So we had to learn them from scratch. This was us when we were stuck, looking miserable..

![Struggling](/img/blog/2017/2017-09-14-stuck-with-coding.jpg )
<div class="image-credits"><b>The struggle was real.. (Image : Google images)</b></div>

To overcome situations like above, we helped each other in this learning curve and got lots of help from our coaches,mentor and our supervisor. We did so many hands-on tutorials together and helped each other to learn fast. So it was not that difficult to complete our learning curve and head back to the implementations. This is our first Open Source project contribution and summer project. So we had to learn the best practices of contributing to open source projects. 


## Learning was our biggest Earning!

At first, we were completely new to Git, since it was our very first summer project and we weren't familiar with most of the git concepts. So during the first two weeks, we learned a lot through tutorials and our coaching sessions. So here we are now, playing with Git like Bosses.. üòé

![Like a Boss](/img/blog/2017/2017-09-14-like-a-boss.gif )
<div class="image-credits"><b>The Git Bosses.. (Image : giphy.com)</b></div>

We were selected for the project *[OpenDF](https://github.com/scorelab/OpenDF)* , since both of us were familiar with Java EE and were ready to solve some of the issues with that knowledge. But our mentor had a different plan for us. So we were given the task to implement a file browser in ReactJS. Actually we think it was an opportunity. Because both of us had no clue about developing a react component. Not even a little! But our mentor opened a door for us to learn something new.., which we think was a blessing. 

Since we were new to the world of ReactJs, we were struggling to figure out how React works, how to work with react boilerplates, how to test react components, what Redux-saga is and etc. So we learned about each of them while working. And we still do. Thanks to our study hours, our mentor and our coaches, now we can work with react components and understand how it works. From each tutorial, each code reviewing session, each coaching session and from each demo session we learned something new and we improved our work. 


## Helping hands

We got a lot of help from our coaches and our mentor to learn these new things very fast while getting the help from our supervisor to manage project work. And they were always there when we got stuck with some issues with our code or any other thing.


* Our mentor, *[Milindu Kumarage](https://lk.linkedin.com/in/agentmilindu)*, Thank you, Mentor Milindu, for your boundless patience while we learned the technologies and unlimited helps given by you when we were stuck with PRs.

* Our supervisor,*[Ram√≥n Huidobro](https://twitter.com/senorhuidobro?lang=en)*, Thank you so much Ramon, for being so flexible when we got problems with managing the time, for guiding us to do the right thing and for all of the motivations and advices.

* Our lead coach *[Kasun Delgolla](https://lk.linkedin.com/in/kasundananjaya)*, Remote Coach *[Tharindu Delgolla](https://lk.linkedin.com/in/tharindudananjaya)* , Coach *[Imran Hishaam](https://lk.linkedin.com/in/imranhishaam)* , Coach *[Udani Gunasena](https://lk.linkedin.com/in/udanie-gunasena-191b8730)* , Coach *[Anuradh Caldera](https://www.facebook.com/chanakanurad)* and Coach *[Damini Satya](https://github.com/daminisatya)* .

## Achievements so far..

So far we've learned many new things about Git, ReactJS, React boilerplates, Redux-saga, Testing react components, API documentations, Swagger and etc. And the best thing is we've already been able to apply most of these concepts successfully. 

We used Trello as a project management tool to manage our tasks while Git as a version control system. They made our work more organized. And so far we've developed three components called SearchView, TreeView and DetailView for our file browser and have got **two** of them **merged** already with the FileBrowser container! üòáüéâ

So this is how our project work looks like at the moment.

## Bonding with the Community

We use this summer as a great opportunity to network with the tech community in Sri Lanka. As the first step we participated Business, Law and Technology Conference 2017 ‚Äì APIIT and Janakshi presented her final year research project and Awarded as the best research paper. 

On our RGSoC day-off, after enjoying our little team time with Ice cream sessions, we participated in Colombo Javascript Meetup at  WSO2 Colombo and learned lots of new things about JSON Web Tokens, Securing NodeJS Rest APIs with JWT and about NodeJS Security. And it was our first Meetup!üéâ

## After this summer

Thanks to RGSoC, this summer is so far the best summer in our lives. And it has opened lots of doors for us. New opportunities, new friends, new way of thinking and etc. 
So we think, we can do more after this summer. After RGSoC, we would love to continue our contributions to **OpenDF**. And we are even planning to participate in next year‚Äôs RGSoC. See how impressed are we from our first RGSoC experience? And we‚Äôll be joining new meetups and giving our support to the tech community more and more by joining meetups, conferences, competitions and engaging in many more open source projects.

And we must mention about the Conferences! Because we will be flying to Australia in 2018 to participate in *[RubyConf AU 2018](https://www.rubyconf.org.au/2018 )* üõ´ and will be participating in *[DEV DAY 2017](http://www.devday.lk/ )* conference as well. We are so excited! üòÅüéâ
