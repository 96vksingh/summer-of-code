# Duo of the moment

[Akarsha](https://github.com/aksh98) and [Ramya](https://github.com/meriki) are not your regular individuals, a dash of crazy, a drop of weird and a couple of undiscovered unusual ingredients makes them up.  They can be found studying in the same college of IIIT Delhi and sharing the same hostel room, adding a whole new meaning to birds of a feather flock together. Their acquaintance started with their mutual interest in coding and fascination for artificial intelligence. Slowly but steadily started bonding and came to realise that despite one being from North India and the other from South, one being a die hard Korean fan and the other a Game of Thrones fan, they are eerily similar. Their sun signs (which both are extremely fond of) also matched! While looking for the perfect team name, ‘Gemini’ which literally means ‘The Twins’ made perfect sense. In the short span of two years, they have managed to gather all sorts of memories with each other, reading for tests together, doing assignments together, bickering and laughing the next moment, watching youtube videos, heated discussions on random topics or just not seeing eye to eye with one other. They’ve been through it all and vehemently attest that their bond keeps going strong because of all their experiences together.

# Why Susi AI?

<div align="center" class="image-credits"> Susi AI logo</div>

The reason both of us decided to venture into Computer Science was because of our fascination with Artificial Intelligence. For us, making a machine emulate human characteristics is a very intriguing and exciting prospect. This mutual interest in Artificial intelligence led us to immediately gravitate towards the Susi AI Server project from the projects offered by RGSoC. 

[Susi AI](http://chat.susi.ai/overview) is an open source artificial Intelligence for chatbots, personal assistants, help desks. Recognising the need to personalise chatbots Susi also provides a platform to personalise skills to a user’s requirements. Given the advent of intelligent chatbots as a new form of instant services, we are thrilled to have the opportunity to actively contribute to the intelligence behind one ourselves. We are learning and growing with Susi, which itself is a relatively new addition to the Fossasia family.

## What we’ve done so far and the Road ahead

Time indeed flies. We’ve already sifted through the large code base, understanding it, made small PRs here and there, learnt git, understand what a frontend architecture like react does and realise the effort that a community does in maintaining a project. It was one hectic month! We are really proud of the progress we’ve made in our open source journey so far.

We aim to solve more complex and core issues now and hope to bring in our own ideas to the project we are working on. Fingers crossed and full steam ahead!
